## Week Plans:

**01-08:**
* Get ESPs
* Get familiar with ESP (how to use it and try a simple hello world project or so)

**08-15:**
* Niklas & Simon: Get Bluetooth frame catching running on ESP and optionally already create some code for the rest of the project
* Lukas & Martin: Research documentation to filter out how backend works and how keys are distributed between client devices. Document everything and present it in the next meeting.
